### Definition of Ready
_A user story is ready when the need is understood and completely described. A user story covers only a small set of features (ideally just a single feature). A user story is small enough to implement in a couple of days. Acceptance criteria are defined. A user story is testable (acceptance criteria help with that)._

### Definition of Done
_A user story is done when the implementation is complete. This includes automated testcases wherever possible. All acceptance criteria are met. All (CICD) pipeline are working. The code is merged into `main`. The application is production ready and can be deployed at any time._
